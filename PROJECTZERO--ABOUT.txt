----------------------------------PROJECTZERO, A FORTNITE HYBRID SERVER----------------------------------

What is that ? 

This is a hybrid fortnite server. Basically it allows you to run old fortnite versions with a couple of clicks... sooo how does that work ?
When you run the installer script, it downloads the old fortnite files and saves them in a specified directory..after that the server.bat file takes care of the rest !
