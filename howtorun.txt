# How to Run ZeroFN
# Created and distributed by @devharris and @ryneex 


#1 ----RUN ZEROFNLAUNCHER----
 
IN THE FOLDER YOU ARE IN, YOU SHOULD SEE AN EXE CALLED ZEROFNLAUNCHER....RUN THAT AS ADMINISTRATOR !! (THIS STEP IS IMPORTANT--IF YOU RUN IT WITHOUT ADMIN PERMS, THE DLL INJECTION MAY NOT WORK!)

#2 ----DOWNLOAD OG FORTNITE----

IF YOU DONT HAVE FORTNITE OG INSTALLED, MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD IT BY CLICKING ON THE BUTTON ---DOWNLOAD--- ON THE LAUNCHER ! (this will download all the required files on the directory you select!)

#3 ----START----

ONCE EVERYTHING IS READY CLICK ON THE START BUTTON ! THIS SHOULD START MULTIPLE CMD'S AND THEN LAUNCH FORTNITE ! YOU ARE DONE ! 


# THANK YOU FOR USING ZEROFN, A FORTNITE PRIVATE SERVER...
